# Core Mantle Boundary - a Summer Project

This is an attempt by the deep Earth group at Leeds
to work together on a small research project over
the summer vacation.

## Tasks
* We need to handle header and tail lines when 
processing an ISC csv file.
* We need a parser for REB files.
* Some picks in the small ISC data set seem 
to be duplicated (same event ID, station name
and reporter). Why?
* Some times in the ISC data set are reported to 
0.01 s, some to 1 s. Why?
* I don't think we handle leap seconds correctly.
* We have not thought about Earth's elipticity.
* We should calculate the change in travel time
caused by a change in CMB depth by changing the 
TauP Earth model. This will be a function of 
z and epicentral distance.
