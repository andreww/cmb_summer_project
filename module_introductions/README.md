        Module introductions
        ====================

This directory includes ipython notebooks
designed to provide background information
for some of the modules we need to use. 
The aim is to allow us to get up to speed
with these.

You should be able to view and run the 
notebooks by starting a local ipython
notebook server with the command:

    ipython notebook

from within this directory. Then open one
of the notbooks from the web page that opens
in your default web browser. Other software 
needed to run each notebook is described 
near the top of the notebook.
