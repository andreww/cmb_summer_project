# Tomographic correction

This uses Fortran (you need gfortran installed)
and the (java) TauP toolkit. Download TauP from
http://www.seis.sc.edu/taup/ then untar and stick
it somewhere. Add:

    export TAUP_HOME=/usr/local/TauP-2.1.1
    PATH="${TAUP_HOME}/bin":$PATH

to .bash_profile

I also needed to install the JDK from a well known
database company.
